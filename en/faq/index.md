# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is a session?

A session in PINGO represents a series of lectures, conferences, etc. One should not create a new session for each new event. Instead, a session should be used over a longer period (e.g. a semester). 

## How do I start surveys from a mobile device?

To use the lecturer's view  on a mobile device, open the following link on your device once:

<http://pingo.upb.de/switch_view?mobile=0>

After visiting the link, the change to the settings is saved as a cookie. Now, you can visit PINGO as usual via pingo.upb.de. PINGO's menu can now be opened by using the button in the top right corner.
