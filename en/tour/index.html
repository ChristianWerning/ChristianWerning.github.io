				<h2>Create a poll without any preparation</h2>
				<p>With PINGOâ€™s quick sessions, it is easy to create a poll on-the-fly during your talk. However, you are also able to prepare questions in advance and load them in your sessions. Sessions have a unique 4-digit ID which work as an access code, so you can use the same session more than once and attendees can use the same access code everytime. Use our question catalogue to share questions with your colleagues or make them public so everybody can copy them into their own catalogue.</p>

				<h2>Any question type you can imagine</h2>
				<p>With multiple-choice, single-choice, tagcloud, and numeric questions, PINGO is a fully featured poll-application.</p>
